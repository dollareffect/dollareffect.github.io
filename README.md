# The Dollar Effect

A subscription system to sponsor a non-profit organization of your choice for $1 a month.

## Getting Started

To be able to make changes in the repository, you need to be added to the github of dollareffect.github.io.
Right now, only Albert can add members. Tag him in the project text channel so he can add you.


### Local Development

There are a lot of local development options you can utilize. You may run the 'index.html' directly in your folder.
Other options are:

1. Jekyll (https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)

2. Netlify CLI (https://www.netlify.com/products/cli/)

    In the project root directory terminal, run 'netlify dev' to start local testing of your changes. The browser should open and you should be able to access it through 'http://localhost:8888'.

    ```
    netlify dev
    ```
